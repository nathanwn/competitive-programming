Observation #1: An inconvenient pair can only exist between two people if they are not standing on two streets with different orientations.

This is trivially provable: without loss of generality, given a pair of people A and B where person A stands on a vertical street x and person B stands on a horizontal street y. The shortest path between them is the path from A to (x, y), then to B.
